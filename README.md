# Ticket Booking System

## Project Overview

This project is part of my practice for **scenario-based problem solving**. It involves creating a web-based ticket booking system for a **Diljit Dosanjh concert**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.

The system is designed to handle the booking process for three sections: **VIP**, **General**, and **Economy**. Users can select seats, and the system manages seat availability and booking confirmations.

## Features

1. **Display Sections**:
   - Three sections available for booking: **VIP**, **General**, and **Economy**.
   - Each section has its own grid layout for seat arrangements.

2. **Seat Layout**:
   - **VIP Section**: 5x5 grid (25 seats).
   - **General Section**: 6x6 grid (36 seats).
   - **Economy Section**: 8x8 grid (64 seats).

3. **Seat Status**:
   - Once a seat is selected by a user, it is marked as booked.
   - A user can book a maximum of 5 seats.
   - Booked seats become unavailable for further bookings.

4. **Booking Confirmation**:
   - After selecting seats, the system confirms the booking by displaying the seat numbers.
   - The system prevents further bookings for already booked seats.

## Scenario

You are tasked with building a ticket booking system for a **Diljit Dosanjh concert**. The system allows users to view seat availability in three different sections and make seat reservations. Each section has a unique grid layout to represent the seating arrangement.

### Sections

1. **VIP Section**: A grid of 5 rows and 5 columns (25 seats in total).
2. **General Section**: A grid of 6 rows and 6 columns (36 seats in total).
3. **Economy Section**: A grid of 8 rows and 8 columns (64 seats in total).

Users can select and book up to 5 seats at a time. Once a seat is booked, it becomes unavailable for other users.
